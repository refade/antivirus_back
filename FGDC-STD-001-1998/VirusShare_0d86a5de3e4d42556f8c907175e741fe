<p>A fine day on Lake Atlantic.</p>
<p>While we were loading our gear, the morning air was still but crisps. The sunrise was painting the high thin clouds with deep shades of orange and red. What a great day! Our trip today, aboard the Independence II was scheduled for the Tolten. This was another one of those wreck that I&#8217;ve never been on. Each time I&#8217;ve scheduled, I&#8217;ve been blown out. Captain Dan also had some numbers he wanted to check out if we had time. Today held promise. We cleared the inlet into near flat seas. The occasional one foot roller went by. The ride out was smooth but cool, so we headed into the heated cabin. We were a couple divers short of a full boat, but this made for more room in the cabin, and more room for catch in the cooler.</p>
<p>We were quickly out to the wreck, but found a fishing boat anchored in place. They offered to share the wreck, so we tied into the bow. The seas were still flat, and the surface was very clear with no current. Once we were tied in divers quickly hit the water and dropped straight down. There was no current, no waves, and 40-50 ft of visibility! Sweet!</p>
<p>The Tolten was a 280 ft freighter sunk by a torpedo in 1942. She&#8217; lies in 90+ ft of water with 15-20 ft of relief. As we hit 40 ft the beacon became visible. At 50 ft the outline of the bow came into view. I leveled out at 60 ft to take in the view, and get my bearings. We were tied into one of the two chains at the bow. The winch and engine used to lift them was exposed with the gears clearly visible. To the right and left were large davits. Beyond this section a large debris field could be seen. There was plenty of ambient light on the wreck. A light would only be needed to look for bugs.</p>
<p>The wreck was covered with fish. A large Schools of Scup was swimming just off the port side. The school would turn in unison lighting up the water with the reflection off their silver sides. Cunners were ever present, nipping at the wreck here and there, watching our every move to see what we might stir up. As we crossed over the top of the wreck a large 4+ ft Jack glided slowly by. Seabass were here and there, and an occasional Tog would poke out from around the corner. Sea robins and skates swam about on the sand with a winter flounder here and there. Even a school of Atlantic Spadefish stopped by briefly. Off in the distance a few Spiny Dogfish would sneak around.</p>
<p>Since I beat Bill into the water for once, I figured it was my best opportunity to look for bugs. Normally there aren&#8217;t many left when he is around. There were quite a few on the small side. Before long, Bill swam by and waved. I pointed him to a larger one beyond my reach, as I continued to work on a 4 lb&#8217;er I had cornered. As it turns out they both had eggs, and I was empty handed for the dive.</p>
<p>During the fight, I had overstayed my time, and paid the price in deco. Hanging on the line was easy with no current, but the water temps seem to be warmer on the bottom or maybe it&#8217;s just deco. Either way the temp read 57 degrees. During the surface interval, some of the high clouds cleared letting the sun through to warm us up. Other divers had better success, and the cooler was filling up with some good sized bugs. We regretted that Louis was down in Florida diving the Ghost Fleet. This left us to our own meager lunches. Next time we&#8217;ll have to put in a real order.</p>
<p>I grabbed my pole spear and headed back for the second dive. The sun was higher in the sky now, and some of the clouds had cleared. Light on the wreck was better, and vis seemed better also. I leveled off 10 ft from the wreck and headed aft. This time I was in search of Seabass. A few of the larger ones were coaxed into my catch bag by the time I reached the boilers. These two cylinders stood some 20+ ft tall. Normally they are good place for fish to hide. I continued aft along the large prop shaft. On the port side of the rudder I ran into a large cube 5 foot on a side with a chain attached to the top. Off to the one side leading away from the wreck was a chain pile.</p>
<p>Passing around the stern and heading back along the prop shaft, I passed over a large Monkfish. I had to think for a moment. Catching a Monkfish is not something to take lightly. First, my bag was already populated with a nice sized Tag that continually reminded me that he was not happy to be there. Then there were a few seabass sharing his angst. With Monkfish, there is an issue of many large sharp teeth, slime, and large size. Not to mention the unpleasant task of cleaning one. At first I started to swim away and look for more seabass, but then I noticed that I was running low on NDL, and headed back. After a few minutes, the engagement ended, and I swam back to the bow with my bag clipped off and a large unhappy Monkfish impaled on my spear (note to self: bring a stringer). When I hit the surface, Bill grabbed the spear, and we dropped the Monkfish into a bucket with some ice. Cleaning will have to wait until I get home. (The neighbors are going to love me.)</p>
<p>The rest of the divers got aboard adding more lobsters to the cooler. Scott pulled the hook and we got underway. Since it was still early, Captain Dan headed out to check out the numbers. With the flat calm conditions, we could easily do a buoy dive to check them out. A few of us stayed in gear ready for a quick look-see. Unfortunately, the numbers didn&#8217;t pan out, so we headed back. All in all, it was a sunny day with flat seas, 57 degree water, and 50 ft of visibility. A great day!</p>

					<h3>September 9 Night Dive on the Independence II</h3>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Fantastic night dive! The air was 78 degrees. The water was 64 degrees top to bottom. The bottom vis was 50ft. 35 or so lobster came up, many in the 3-5 lb range, and a few scallops for good measure.</p>
<p><strong>Details</strong>:</p>
<p>With a full boat and a little trepidation we set out on the Independence II for a much anticipated night dive on the undisclosed lobster spot. Getting out of the inlet was slow going, but once clear the seas dropped down to the 2-4ft NOAA was forecasting. The major concern was the 12 ft seas over the weekend. Last week there was over 50ft of vis. What affect would the rough seas have on the bottom vis and temps? Capt Dan kept telling us, &#8220;I leave the diving to you , you leave the <strong>DRIVING</strong> to me&#8221;.</p>
<p>The boat looked like a page from rebreather world. There were Megaladons, Inspirations, Evolutions and a Kiss or two. That was only half the boat. The rest was filled with doubles and a couple of singles. On the way out Dan passed around a drawing of the wrecks layout. There was a quick discussion that the tie in would be on the boiler. When we got to the wreck the crew deployed the new laser guided shot line to hit the boilers. It must have worked, because Mark had us tied in within minutes.</p>
<p>The plan was to do an early dusk dive for orientation, then a night dive after the surface interval. Groups of divers quickly dropped in, and we watched them descend through the clear water. If the surface vis was any clue, the bottom should be nice. As I was gearing up, Mark returned with a report: 50+ ft of vis and 64 degrees top to bottom.</p>
<p>My plan was to keep the first dive short, and save the bottom time for the second dive. I soon rolled in and dropped down the line. There was no current on the line as I passed other divers on their ascent. I could not resist the urge to yank on a few fins on the way by. At the 60ft mark I could see the beacon below me. This was going to be a good dive! At 70 ft the wreck was visible. The sand was at 120+, so I leveled off at 100 ft, and started to reconnoiter. The layout was clearly visible, and easy to navigate. The sun was high enough in the sky that lights were not necessary. I was amazed how much this looked like the drawing Dan passed around.</p>
<p>The Fluke seem to know that they were just out of season as the swam around the wreck openly. Then again, it is their spawning season. Some real doormats were chasing each other around the wreck. One or two winter flounder were also about. A few large Seabass made me regret leaving my spear at home. Of course Ling are a prerequisite on wrecks of this depth, along with the Ocean Pouts peering out from under the wreck. Even a few Tog made an appearance. Sea Ravens, Sea Robins, and some Porgies rounded out the predominant fish population.</p>
<p>Detecting a slight current, I headed into it toward one end of the wreck. Passing the bow, I headed out into the sand for a few scallops. After grabbing a couple, I passed a few scattered pieces of debris, with telltale antenna. While I&#8217;m not the best lobsterman, I can try, and grabbed a pair on the smaller side. Heading back over the main wreckage, claws could be seen in every nook, or at least those that did not have Ocean Pouts. My plans had changed, and the short first dive turned into the contingency plan dive. Just didn&#8217;t want to go up. The light was fading, and the lobsters were getting bolder.</p>
<p>I hit the surface with the last of the crew. With two captains aboard, Dan was able to splash and enjoy a dusk dive with Louis and Carrie while the rest of us did our surface interval. They returned laughing! Why? It was just that nice a dive, and they had a good number of crustaceans between them.</p>
<p>Did I mention that this was a catered event? During the surface interval we were treated to a large deli tray complements of Louis. Quality deli meats and cheeses, potato salad, pickles, cookies. Just the thing to keep your energy up for the second dive. Now it was time for round two.</p>
<p>I splashed right after Bill T. I wanted to get a couple of lobster, so I could not leave him on the wreck for long. The sun had set and it was now quite dark. The beacons could be seen almost immediately. We dropped down the line quickly. I was right behind Bill, but not closed enough. He was already bagging a bug as I hit the bottom. They were everywhere! The small ones were roaming around like ants, ok ants with claws. You didn&#8217;t want to touch the bottom for fear of hurting them. The bigger ones were emerging, and could be cornered away from the safety of home. Eels were also about hunting in the dark. Many fish were sleeping about the wreck, with the exception of the Fluke which were now in full hunting mode. More could be seen now than during the day. Did I mention that Lobsters were everywhere? It was an amazing dive.</p>
<p>After grabbing a few, and trying to coax a few larger ones out of hastily chosen crevices, it was time to head up. The hang was surreal. You could not see divers, just lights. Below they were flickering as they passed around the wreck, and were obscured by the rising bubbles. There was no current. We hung by the line motionless counting down the minutes.</p>
<p>I climbed aboard and began to get out of my gear as Dan and crew were banding and sorting out the lobster bags. After the last few divers came up, we ran through roll call. Scott pulled the hook, and we and headed back. What a great dive!</p>

					<h3>September 22 Inside the Stolt, Dive on the Independence II</h3>
<p>Sunday we headed out on the Independence II for a trip to the Stolt. Once again NOAA was able to show their inability to provide an accurate forecast (2-4). The wind was light and variable as we left the inlet. It looked to be a great day. Arriving at the wreck the sea was almost flat with just a hint of a breeze. Terry jumped in to tie. We could see him clearly as he dropped down. Once he signaled that we were in, we started to pull up the slack on the line. We could see that Terry had left one of his bottles by the anchor. That&#8217;s 60&#8242; of visibility! Nice!</p>
<p>The plan for the day was two fold. The first was to give my drysuit it&#8217;s first salt water bath. While I&#8217;ve had it almost a year, I was waiting for my old suit to fail before switching to the new one. At that point, I could send the old one in for some repairs/alterations. I gave up waiting, and used the new suit. The second part of the plan was to do my first penetration dive on the Stolt. I&#8217;ve been to the wreck many times, but never went inside. This was mainly a result of arriving without a suitable dive buddy, or one with other plans.</p>
<p>Divers were already rolling in as Louis and I got our gear together. We dropped in and did some buddy checks at 15&#8242;. We could already see the wreck below us, and to our surprise there was almost no current. REAL Nice! With the light current, it might have been a nice time to head out into the sand for some scallops, but that was not our dive plan. We dropped down slowly looking for an entrance into the wreck. There was a thermocline about 110ft. Below that the vis dropped off quickly. We could barely see the lights of divers on the bottom. We stayed just above the thermocline and headed aft. Reaching the stern, we found a suitable entrance, about 4 ft square. I tied off my reel, and headed inside.</p>
<p>With the wreck laying on the starboard side, directions were confused. The deck was to our left and the port side above us. The entrance opened into a room about 20ft square. The walls were bare, but covered with rust. The bottom was covered in silt and mussel shells. Here and there were large starfish clinging to the &#8220;walls&#8221;. I expected to see fish swimming about, but there were only a couple cunners hiding in corners next to an opening. Passing through a hatchway at the end of the room we emerged into a large area with huge equipment hanging from what had been the deck. While the water seemed clear, our lights could not penetrate to the far bulkheads. On our right light poured in through huge openings, so much for the reel.</p>
<p>We spent some time swimming around the gear in this space. We could not see above us to the port side of the ship. From what we could tell this was the engine room. What appeared to be a series of huge rocker valves were lined up in the center. The water was completely still. In this circumstance being on rebreathers has some real advantages. First we did not send up any bubbles to disturb the silt above us. Second the buoyancy was effortless. We floated around the the room in erie silence. Third, we could easily talk to each other, although our voices were a little squeaky.</p>
<p>We investigated a few other openings as we wandered around the room. We stopped here and there to searched the bottom for fallen items. Time went quickly, and Louis signaled time to turn around. He headed out before me as I reeled up the line. I stopped to grab something out of the silt, then untied the reel and headed out. As we headed up and forward, toward the line, we ran across another opening to a 20 square room. This one had stands welded on the floor for tables. We search it quickly finding tiles still stuck to the deck. We tried to find some loose ones, but were not successful. I&#8217;m sure there were some buried in the silt, but I was not prepared to look for them (new suit).</p>
<p>We continued to head back toward the anchor, peering into each hole along the way. As we hit the break, a large Tog swam around from the other side and almost ran into me. Of course, I had not weapon in hand. Reaching the top (port) we noticed a large opening right there on the other side of the tie-in. Ok, That&#8217;s the plan for the next dive. Deco went quickly since we had not been all that deep. With the slack current, we could hang by the line and watch the plankton.</p>
<p>Back on the boat, we feasted on another of Barson&#8217;s fine platters. I really have to stop bringing Wawa lunches. The time went quickly as we exchanged stories of what was seen. Some spoke of swimming through the wreck and silting up the compartment, other spoke of lobster. Terry had been out in the sand looking for scallops, but reported on a mass migration. Either the scallop boats had dared to come close, or the scallops had packed their bags and gone north for the winter. Either way he was empty handed. Next time he was going for that Tog. The wind had picked up. The flags were whipping, and the 2 foot waves were already forming white caps.</p>
<p>Back in for the second dive. Louis ran the reel this time, tying just below the anchor. The passage lead down. It almost felt like we were walking through the passageways and hatches of the ship as we passed from the port to the starboard side. We had to turn occasionally, but there was always plenty of room. This is a plus for someone my size. We looked in several small rooms, but continued through the larger passageways.</p>
<p>Suddenly I noticed that the water was not as clear. Had we hit a compartment the others had silted up? I did not think so since the vis was still good, but here and there were wisps of silt. Soon, daja-vu set in, and I recognized one of the side rooms we investigated in the earlier dive. Turn right, and yup, there&#8217;s the engine! OK, back to the entrance. We checked out a few more side passageways, but generally headed back up. Louis unclipped, and we started looking for another way in. We check out a ladder way we had seen before, but it was a little tight. We were running low on time, so we went to phase two of the plan: grab some mussels on the way up. By the time we reached the line we both had a good bag. The line was now being pulled up and down with good force. The seas were picking up. Louis finished deco and got aboard. Always happy to do more deco rather than less, I waited with the last diver as he finished up.</p>
<p>We broke the surface in 5-6 ft seas. Boarding the ladder in 6ft seas with 50 lb of mussels is going to be fun (note to self, bring equipment line). We got onboard and started stowing gear on the pitching deck. Terry pulled the hook, and we got underway. I stayed in my suit and cleaned mussels on the back deck. The spray over the side was enough to wash down the deck. We were riding almost directly into the waves, so Capt Frank cut back on the speed. We still made good time, as I finishing up just as we hit the inlet. One stop on the way home for a bottle of white, and then there&#8217;s an evening of cooking mussels in garlic and wine.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing like watching the sunset from the deck with a glass of wine, a bowl of mussels, and wet dive gear all around.</p>

<p>Summary:<br />
Sunday 8/6 Trip on the Independence II to the Resor. The surface temp was 70+ while the bottom was 47. Highlights include: 40-50 ft of visibility, 30 some big lobster, scallops, enormous Tautog, and a great wreck for us sightseers.</p>
<p>Details:<br />
We jumped aboard the Divers Den North charter on the Independence II. Our destination was the Resor. All of my previous attempts to dive the Resor had been blown out, so I was very happy with the marine forecast for the weekend. Given the distance offshore, we gathered early at the dock. The trip out was in 2-3 ft of long period chop, which died down as the day wore on. The sky was clear with a slight east breeze that cooled us off. We could not have asked for a nicer day.</p>
<p>Captain Dan lined us up on the stern section of the wreck. Paul jumped in and had us tied in 5 minutes or less. Most of the group jumped in looking for lobsters and scallops. This was my first time here, so when I hit the wreck with 50 ft of vis, I just took the 50 cent tour. The tie-in was at 80 ft, and the bottom at 120-130. There was a very mild current. With this vis, you could see the bottom from the tie in. It took all of the first dive to circle the stern. It was a leisurely swim around the structure hovering about 20 ft off the bottom. I could see divers below hunting for bugs. Paul was nice enough to tied off the far end of his reel by the deck gun, leaving his reel there to aid the sightseers. After passing that, I was looking into each hole we passed. Lots of fish were hiding inside the wreck, as well as swimming on the down current side. The wreck is covered with flowing anemones. In the mild current they were all out swaying in to and fro. Just an incredibly picturesque dive!</p>
<p>There was a bit of a current between 50ft and 20ft as we came up the line. Nothing unmanageable, but it left me wishing I had brought a John-line. When I got back on board, I was amazed to see the number and size of the lobsters that came up, but no scallops on this dive. The other divers were banding their catch and covered the bottom of the big cooler. Bullet shell casings were apparently found on the bottom by many of the divers. Paul explained the structure of the wreck, and how to get to the bow section by passing over the debris field. After a good surface interval of swapping stories, it was time to see the rest of the wreck.</p>
<p>I tied a reel by the line, and headed out over the debris field. Hovering above the wreck gave a great panoramic view. The debris was scattered with large open scallop shells and clam shells were also common. Ling cod swam about as well as some large Tog. Here and there were some seabass. Arriving at what I believe was the bow, there were several places where rope was a tell tale sign of previous dives. The section was full of large holes deep into the structure exposing the decks below. I caught a glimpse of a very large Tog gliding slowly away from me around the hull. Sorry, no weapon in hand.</p>
<p>On the way back to the line, I was escorted by a large Monkfish which happened to be swimming in the same direction. Unlike most fish, he seemed to be oblivious to my light. While unclipping the reel there was another very large Tog gliding about the top of the stern. There were a few minutes of planned bottom time left, so I stalked him as he passed in and out of the wreck. Back on the line, the current had died down a bit, making the hang more comfortable. I could see lobsters and scallops in the catch bags above me. Alas, mine was empty. Again I boarded the boat to see divers loading the cooler with more lobster. The final count I heard was 30. While other divers had quite a few, but I think the Bill Trent, of Adventure Scuba fame, had the most big bugs + scallops.</p>
<p>Paul Wittaker was already in the water to take a few pictures and then pull the “hook”. We were quickly underway. Before long, everyone had found a spot to take a quick nap on the hour + trip to the marina. The skies were still clear as we unloaded our gear and headed home thinking “What a great day”!</p>

<p>Summary:<br />
Saturday 8/5 Trip on the Independence II to the Stolt. The surface temp was 75+ while the bottom was 50. Highlights include: 30ft of visibility, lobster, scallops, mussels, mermaids and delivery service???? Something’s not right!</p>
<p>Details:<br />
The crew from Adventure Scuba of Conshohocken, PA headed out on the Independence II to the Stolt Dagali. Always looking to clock some more time on my KISS rebreather, I joined the trip.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the wreck, there was a dive boat already tied in. Since their group was finishing up their first dive, they offered to share the wreck. The timing worked out well as they would be doing their surface interval while we dove and vise versa. Bill Trent was crew this day. Since he and I have buddied up on previous dives, I was planning to jump in with him, help tie, then do our dive. With the other boat in place, the plan changed. We could not drop a line, so Bill swam the chain down the other boats line. Divers coming up gave us quite a puzzled look as we went by. Bill was Open Circuit and I was CCR, so he could drop down the line much quicker than I could. I was really no help at all. He quickly found a spot to tie in, as I was still getting neutral. I arrived just in time to send up the signal.</p>
<p>We headed down to the sand to look around. Winter flounder where so thick you could not swim more than a foot or two without scaring one away. Some were so large, I thought they were fluke. Unfortunately they stirred up the bottom as they left. Lobsters were abundant, and even I was able to get my hands on a few. Mine were on the short side though so I left them to scurry back to their holes. Bill had a few nice bugs in his bag, and was now fighting with a big one, deep under the wreck. I could not see him through the silt, but on occasion I caught a glimpse of the glow of his bright 21 watt HID. Eventually he was the victor. He emerged from the silt and gave the signal to head up. We did not have a scale, but I’d guess the bug was in excess of 3lb.</p>
<p>Some of our divers were just headed down as we went up the line . Only the crew was left on the boat as we arrived. Before long, bikini clad women started swimming by the boat. Is this normal on your dive trips? As it turned out, the other boat was chartered by an all women dive group out of New York. Several members of the group knew Captain Dan and Captain Jay, and have been on the Independence before. With the boats only 30 some feet apart, and the water temp near 80, they decided to stop over to say hi.</p>
<p>The divers on our boat were all men, and the boats were tied into the wreck close together. You can imagine the confusion as our divers climbed up the ladder to see women aboard. After the first double take, many had to check the large letters on the stern, clearly spelling out “Independence II”. Yup, this is the right boat.</p>
<p>Shortly the other boat started up their grill and we were awash with the smell of barbecue. More and more women stopped by mentioning that there was a huge spread of food aboard, far too much for them to finish. Before long the ladies graciously stopped back with some of the leftovers: ribs, chicken, salsa, chips, salad and finally margaritas all wrapped in Ziploc bags. This was the first time I’ve seen food delivered on the Stolt. It was all quite tasty, and after smelling the barbecue for the last hour, we were getting very hungry. The margaritas would have to wait for the end of the second dive.</p>
<p>We headed in for a quick dive, and then to pull the hook. Dave had seen a large lobster in a pipe below our line. Bill and I looked for it, but with no luck. We circled around the side of the wreck into the current. Bill picked up a few more lobster before we headed up to untie. I tried to provide some assistance this time by getting some slack on the line. A few seconds latter and we were flying over the bottom. We scurried up, did our hang, and boarded the boat. We were quickly on our way back from one of the more memorable diving days.</p>
<p>Thanks, ladies for stopping by. It was good to meet you, and the food was great. Whoever made those ribs, they were fantastic! This is one diving day we&#8217;ll be talked about for a while.</p>
